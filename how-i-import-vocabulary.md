## How I import vocabulary

The following applies to Dragon 6.

- `drag vocabularly`
- select user vocabulary only (top left -> User)
- `olly` (select all)
- `junk` (delete)
- `shock` (dismiss info dialog)
- select import (settings icon -> import)
- `olly` (select all)
- `shock` (Ok!)
- `shock` (dismiss dialog)
- close window

### Training individual words

Many of us (VoiceCode users) have seen serious hangs/delays if you just import the files, so we delete the old vocabulary entries first. If you've trained any individual words, you'll lose that. I *think* it just takes a really long time to import if you don't delete first, so maybe you can wait until the end of the day or something.
